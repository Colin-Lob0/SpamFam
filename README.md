# SpamFam
## An ML model that can Identify the different kinds of spam mail received.

This is a project done as a group in the GAIP program. 

The datasets used to train this model are the datasets of Kaggle and Huggingface and  some data scraped from our very own emails.
We  divided the spam mail into categories - fake jobs, fraudulent, adult content and newsletters.

We trained multiple models and chode the one with the best accuracy (random forest).
All models can be viewed in the notebook "Model_V1.ipynb"
To run the model use the "To_be_used_Model_V1 (1).ipynb" notebook.

note: check the path of the dataset and the column names.

The objective of this project was to create and understand the different ML models and the accuracy that they can provide in  identifying the different types of spam mail.
Project done by - Kunal, Kritik,  Abhijai, Deepanshu, Pallawi and myself.
